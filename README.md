# This is the final project for an Advanced Java Class focusing on Web Services
A simple e-class system made with Netbeans, Java, .jsp, HTML, REST WS + JSON, Glassfish + SQL 

Made in a week, not a polished project. Contains Greek Language/Format etc.

DesktopApp is our desktop client that can only be used by the administrator and the secretary.
WebApp is used by students.
Services contains all the webservices that we use in both the web and desktop client


To run this correctly you will need XAMMP , SQL Glassfish 

P.S Resolve Jar issues by adding them through the jar_lib dir.
